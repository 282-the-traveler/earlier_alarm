# earlier_alarm

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is for my side project.
It is an app for the people who are late when the weather condition is not good.
This alarm alerts the setting time earlier when rainy or snowy day.

For example, you set alarm at 7:00 am in the morning and you set 30 minutes earlier for bad weather day,
if it rains today morning, alarm alerts at 6:30 am, 30 minutes earlier than 7:00 am.
You can't be late!
